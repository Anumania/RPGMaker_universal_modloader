# RPGMaker(vxa, vx, xp)_universal_modloader

## IF YOU WANT TO USE MODS:
~~download save16.rvdata2, download your mod of choice, place save16 in the same directory as the exe, place your mod into the mods folder, start the game, load save 16.
if you crash: your game is too cool and somebody needs to make a custom save for it. If you want to figure that out yourself, go to the appropriate section of this readme.~~
youre outta luck until people make mods using this. if you want to anyways, ive got https://github.com/Anumania/RPGMaker-VX-ACE-online- 
## IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MODS:
Create a new RPGMaker VXAce project, open the script editor and delete every script including main. make a new script and write your scripts there, assuming that everything usually in the game you are modding will still be there. Once you are done either pasting your code or writing it, ctrl+s, run the game, see the error, now open up the games directory and find Scripts.rvdata2. That is your mod. You are welcome to name it whatever you wish, preferrably not Scripts.rvdata2. Keep in mind that if you are making for mkxp that you cannot use Win32API and by extension, dlls.
