# RPGMaker_universal_modloader
A save file for rpgmaker vx ace(currently the only version) that allows whatever rpgmaker game you play it on to load content from outside of encrypted archives(or unencrypted).
No shenanigans, just drop the save file into whatever rpgmaker vx ace game you wish, drop the example Scripts.rvdata2 in, load save file 16, and you will have a main menu with a "new game" button that has been replaced with "test", not very impressive, but if you have your own version of rpgmaker vx ace, you can make scripts to overwrite scripts in already existing games, and distribute them without worrying about redistributing a creators work.
